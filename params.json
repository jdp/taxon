{"name":"Taxon","body":"# Taxon\r\n\r\nTaxon is a tagged data store with persistence to a Redis backend. It allows you to organize and query Redis data sets with tags.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Fully queryable. Supports expressions using `And`, `Or`, and `Not` operations as well as direct tag lookup.\r\n* Persistent. Data is stored in Redis.\r\n* Integrated. Taxon wraps ``Redis`` objects, and proxies Redis commands to Taxon through it.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nFirst install the taxon package with pip:\r\n\r\n    $ pip install -U redis-taxon\r\n\r\nThen you can instantiate Taxon stores in your code that wrap ``Redis`` objects from [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py).\r\n\r\n    import redis\r\n    import taxon\r\n\r\n    t = taxon.Taxon(redis.Redis())\r\n\r\nTo tag data, use the `tag` method on a `taxon.Taxon` object.\r\n\r\n    t.tag('feature', ['issue-312', 'issue-199', 'issue-321'])\r\n    t.tag('experimental', ['issue-199'])\r\n\r\nTo get the items associated with the tag, you can provide the `Store.query` method with the name of the tag. The return value is a tuple of the key in which the result is stored, and the set of items in the result.\r\n\r\n    key, items = t.query('feature')\r\n\r\n## Querying\r\n\r\nTaxon allows the dataset to be queried with arbitrary expressions and supports `And`, `Or`, and `Not` operations. The query syntax is a small DSL implemented directly in Python.\r\n\r\n    from taxon import Taxon\r\n    from taxon.query import And, Or, Not\r\n\r\n    # get issue tracker items with no action required\r\n    t = Taxon(my_redis_object)\r\n    _, items = t.query(Or('invalid', 'closed', 'wontfix'))\r\n\r\nQuery expressions can also be arbitrarily complex.\r\n\r\n    # get issue tracker items marked feature or bugfix, but not experimental\r\n    _, items = t.query(And(Or('feature', 'bugfix'), Not('experimental')))\r\n\r\nThere is an alternate query syntax available using the `Tag` member from `taxon.query` which uses operators instead of classes. The operators are `&` for `And`, `|` for `Or`, and `~` for `Not`. The above query in operator syntax looks like this:\r\n\r\n    from taxon.query import Tag\r\n    _, items = t.query((Tag('feature') | Tag('bugfix')) & ~Tag('experimental'))\r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Justin Poliey <justin@getglue.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
